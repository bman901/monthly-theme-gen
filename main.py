# Theme Suggestion Engine (Phase 1 of Build - Normalised + Reuse)
"""
This module will:
- Run on the 1st of each month
- Generate 3‚Äì5 campaign themes for each segment (pre-retirees, retirees)
- Reuse themes from the last 6 months that are still unselected/unsent
- Avoid inserting duplicate subject lines
- Store each theme as its own row in Airtable (with subject + description)
- Send a notification email with a summary of the themes
